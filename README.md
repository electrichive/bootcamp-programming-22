## Don't panic

If something’s not working, that’s perfectly normal. You’ll get used to it, that sometimes things don’t go as you planned, even when you are following precise instructions.

## Git

### What is git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. [More about git.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-learn-git-version-control/)

### Do you have git installed on your computer?

On **Windows**, open the *Command Line* or *PowerShell*.

On **Mac** or **Linux** open *Terminal*.

```Terminal

```

If you get a result similar to the following you are good to go:

```Terminal
git version 2.35.3
```

### What to do when you don't have git installed?

Well, you'll need to install it.

There’s a guide on the official Git website, that you can follow. [Click here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

If you are on **Windows** [here](https://shalmonanandas.github.io/tutorials/2022/04/05/Git-+-Github-for-beginners.html) is a detailed guide, which includes the setup of Windows Terminal as well.

For setting up a GitHub repository, you can check [this](https://shalmonanandas.github.io/tutorials/2022/04/05/Git-+-Github-for-beginners.html) guide from the 5th chapter.
